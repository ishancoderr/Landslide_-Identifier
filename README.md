# Landslide_-Identifier
Landslides often interfere with the economic development of rural communities. Our target is to make a system for warning them before the hazard.

## Factors considered

In here, we were considered six factors for this task. The research reports and geological references were used to select those factors.
Topographic parameters like slope, curvature and distance to stream maps were derived from Digital Elevation Model of Badulla District.
Landslide occurs more frequently on steeper slopes due to gravity stress. 
Curvature was classified into 3 classes of concave, convex and flat surfaces. In heavy rainfall, a convex or concave slope contains more water and retains this water for a longer period. So, more positive or negative values indicate the higher probability of landslide occurrence. In the flat curvature, the probability of landslide occurrence is very low. 
Distance to stream is an important factor that dictates the landscape evolution of the area and an indicator of the landslide and related erosional aspects. 
Landslides are greatly controlled by the lithology properties of the land surface. Since different lithological units have different landslide susceptibility values. They are very important for providing data for susceptibility and it displays approximate boundaries of geology. 

Rainfall is considered as an influencing factor to cause slope instability. Precipitation is a controlling factor that triggers landslides by providing water thereby increasing underground hydrostatic level and pore water pressure. 
Land-use change has been recognized throughout the world as one of the most important factor influencing the occurrence of rainfall-triggered landslides. Vegetation has a major contribution to resist slope movements.
